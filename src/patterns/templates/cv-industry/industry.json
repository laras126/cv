				"<b>Business Insights:</b> Understood business roadmap and AI opportunities to create an internal framework to understand how to look at Human-centered approaches for AI product development across domains, identifying four main areas of opportunity to maximize the value of AI for the organization: adoption, user empowerment, human-AI collaboration and governance. Recommended actionable research agendas prioritized against business impact, and presented to Leadership Teams across Merck divisions (Human Health, Animal Health and R&D).",
				"<b>Research Design:</b> Designed and conducted applied research through ethnographic observation and interviews with 25+ stakeholders including product designers, data scientists, analysts, leadership, and sales management across business units. Identified adoption bottlenecks as a primary business challenge; translated findings into additional targeted research protocols and frameworks.",
				"<b>Technology Enablement:</b> Improved adoption of new Gen AI product to enhance field sales reps' customer engagement by developing research protocols to better understand main pain points and opportunities in current ways of working. Identified through surveys different user segments influencing adoption and scalability, interviewed users from each group to assess the impact of AI on sales reps' work, and proposed design to maximize adoption of the new solutions. ",
				"<b>Knowledge Sharing:</b> Summarized, extracted and presented key insights from my academic research on human-AI collaboration to a broader internal audience. Delivered several presentations to the AI Leadership Team and internal Responsible AI group of 100+, facilitating cross-functional knowledge sharing."
